# My Userscripts
A collection of my userscripts. I'm very rusty with JS so they'll mainly be userscript-ized userstyles for the time being.

# Prerequisites
Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey optional for my userscrpts unless duly noted.

Only tested on Vivaldi (Chromium) on Ubuntu (Linux) so let me know if you deal with any issues on other browsers/operating systems.

# License
GNU GPLv3, feel free to fork, customize, whatever you want, however you want. I'm not expecting anybody to make millions off my lzy code, hahah.
